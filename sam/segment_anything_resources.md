I worked with this [link from huggingface](https://huggingface.co/ybelkada/segment-anything)

## Read this (https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything/blob/main/notebooks/automatic_mask_generator_example.ipynb)

Checkpoints can be downloaded from this [link.](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything#model-checkpoints)I downloaded the **default or vit_h: ViT-H SAM model.**

These instructions were followed accordingly for my case:
```bash
pip3 install huggingface_hub
pip3 install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
pip3 install opencv-python pycocotools matplotlib onnxruntime onnx
```
